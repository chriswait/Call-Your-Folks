# CallYourFolks
An app to remind you to keep up correspondence with the people you love â€” Edit

Since moving to Australia, I've found it challenging to keep in touch with people back home. I was thinking about projects which try to use technology to solve what is ultimately a human problem, and thought this would be a good candidate for falling into the same trap.

Currently, the backend allows you to:
* add people you'd like to keep in touch with, 
* configure roughly how often to keep in touch, and
* keep track of the last time you communicated with them (manually, because integration is non-trivial)

The app then works out, based on a simple algorithm and previous data, which person you should get in touch with next to try to minimise overdue correspondence.
